<p>The Vancouver Data Driven Wellness Meetup meets on the second Thursday of the month from 7-10pm at <a href="http://creativecoworkers.com/">Creative Coworkers</a>. <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Creative+Coworkers/@49.2841709,-123.0992541,17.44z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x66a7569c05387d5"> [MAP] </a></p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataDrivenWellness/">meetup.com group </a>.</p>

<p> If you're interested in wellness; including nutrition, mindfulness, values, and self-awareness, and want to improve these things for yourself and for the community from a data driven perspective, welcome.</p>

<p>We will be drawing from already-published and scrutinized data/conclusions, and then specifically how a Vancouverite can take action (including through products/services/groups) as well as formulating new hypotheses and tests and doing measurements here in Vancouver. </p>

<p> This is a collaborative group, and the only criticisms invited should be constructive. </p>

<p> When you're at the next meeting, be sure to ask to be added to the members Slack/chat group. </p>
